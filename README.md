# Restaurant

Dear Sir or Madam

I am sending solved tasks.
For the first Java task, I decided to write a program with an interface and I used for it JavaFX.
I attached the runable jar file(Restaurant.jar), to run the program, and the whole project in zip.

To the second task from the tatabases i attached a file called SQL queries.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your replay.
PS If something is wrong, please send me a massage.

Best regards
